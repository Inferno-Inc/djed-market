Our friends use Djed. We believe the content in Djed is private content. We also believe Djed should provide a safe haven from social media sites (which, of course, we love too, sort of).</p><p>Djed Studios LLC and its affiliates (“Djed,” “we,” or “us”) values the importance of safeguarding the personal and family information that is stored in the Djed Service. In this Privacy Policy, we’d like to explain what information is collected, how it is handled and what we may use it for. As used in this policy the “Service” means the features and services we make available, including through our website at djed.com and any other Djed branded websites (including international and mobile versions) and related services, plugins, apps and APIs. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use or disclosure of information that is collected or obtained by us through means other than the Djed Service.</p><p>When you sign up for Djed you need to enter a name (it could simply be “Mom” or “Dad” or “Batman”) and a valid email address (obviously). We’ll use this email to send you system information and other alerts (you can configure the options). If you want other members of your family to use Djed you need to share their name (or nickname) and email address. You can add your baby, your toddler, your teenager, your dog or cat or frog or whatever family member you want and NOT put an email address for that family member and you can still keep track of information about that family member and they will never have to use Djed. We track information about our pets all the time and our own children (collectively, we have many children). Some children use Djed (the Terms of Use describes our simple policy) although no pets use Djed (yet).</p><p>In Djed a family member can share content with other family members. We designed Djed for this particular reason and it’s obvious the minute you’ve set up your own family. We also allow families to connect to other families like relatives and dear friends and form what we call a <b>Tribe</b>. If you share content with other families, you can easily remove them from specific content or remove the family altogether.</p><p>The only personal information we encourage you to share with other families as you build your Tribe is your name (which is not mandatory in Djed), and a recent avatar (also not mandatory). Your name and avatar gives other families a quick way to know who is asking to connect and gives them a quick view of what you look like in case you’re a really distant relative or you’ve gone bald (kidding). You can have your name and avatar be whatever you want, it’s your account and your family. Keep it Weird, we say in Austin.</p><p>Djed will have the ability to integrate with other sites and applications and share items (such as photos), but you will always control when content is pushed to them. The content you create might be very fun and social, like photos from a sports season or the list of presents from your birthday party. Or it might be very sensitive like health information, documents about your house and car, or your account information for iTunes. Each family and each user can decide whom to share content with. Family leaders can always modify family content that they can see, including permissions. This is easy to do and it’s very clear how to do it. If you disagree, let us know and we’ll put it as priority 1 to fix.</p><p>If you’ve added a family member you don’t want to be part of Djed, you can remove the family member. If you want to remove a connection to another family (in your Tribe) you can easily do that too. If you want to disconnect from Djed and delete all your content that’s also easy and we don’t hassle you forty-seven times about all the fun you’re missing.</p><hr class=hr-privacy><h3>Changes To This Policy</h3><p>As Djed evolves, we reserve the right to update this policy, or any other policy or practice, at any time, with reasonable notice to users of the Services. We will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon such notice. Please note that your continuation of using Djed after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any changes in this Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Policy, you will need to delete your account.</p><hr class=hr-privacy><h3>Policies For Children</h3><p>Djed is an application for the whole family and we want to keep children as safe as possible. Therefore, we adhere to the restrictions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under 13 without first receiving verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. (For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href=http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm target=_blank>http://1.usa.gov/1MARFu5</a>).</p><p>To protect the privacy and safety of children, a Family Leader must be at least 13 years old. Users under 13 can use Djed, but only with the consent of a parent or guardian.</p><p>By accepting our Terms Of Service, you are agreeing to the following:</p><ul><li>You are over 13 if a family leader</li><li>When giving your consent for a person under 13 to use Djed, you are a parent or guardian for this person and are consenting to allow personal information to be collected</li></ul><hr class=hr-privacy><h3>Email and Text Alerts</h3><p>This is a digital product (obviously). If you want to reset your (strong) password we'll send you an email for security purposes. If you're invited to connect to another family we'll send you an email. If you don't want to receive the other useful email or text alerts you can turn them off. If you don't want to receive our product announcements (which may be awesome, who knows) or interesting facts about the company, you can turn those alerts off too. Like you, we use a lot of Internet products and we're sensitive to how busy everyone is.</p><hr class=hr-privacy><h3>Data Mining and Advertising</h3><p>We don't sell (or rent) your information to advertisers. We don't read your content and send it to Honda or Tesla, or that anti-aging formula. We don't do any data mining.</p><h4>Automated Data Collection</h4><p>To make our Service more useful to you, Djed collects industry standard tracking data from everyone who visits our Sites. This includes log data that automatically records information about your visit, such as your browser type, operating system, the URL of the page that referred you, the different actions you performed, and the IP address you used to access pages on the Site. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account on our network.</p><p>This data is stored separately and not assigned to any identifiable person when being used for Analytics. Djed also uses Google Analytics to help with collecting and analyzing this data.</p><p>For protecting you in the event of a security breach, some data is securely logged and associated with the logged in user so we can accurately report back to you exactly what happened.</p><h4>Data Entered by Users</h4><p>You can only use Djed by registering for a Family and User Account (or have a Family Leader register a User Account for you). To do this, you must enter your name, email address and select a password. We require these data points in order to guarantee that you are able to make full use of our entire offer. We need these and possibly other data not least in order to respond to your questions. You can also provide other personal information to fill out your profile as well as to store personal and family data. You can use explicit permissions to control the sharing of your information. All data entered will be integrated into a database or reside on secure file servers. The purpose of this database is to allow you to use Djed with various devices (that have an Internet Browser) and call up your data anywhere and at any time. Data is transmitted to the respective device using SSL encryption so that your data is transmitted securely.</p><p>In some cases we may also request additional information from you for security reasons to provide specific services such as financial integration and fitness integration. We collect personally identifiable and transactional information when you: (1) purchase products or services via the Service, (2) request to receive additional information regarding products or services, or (3) send us a question. If you choose not to give information we request, you can still use most of the Service, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.</p><p>Besides the minimal required account setup data, any additional data stored in Djed is entirely voluntary.</p><ul><li><b>Third party credentials:</b> You may also enter in certain passwords, usernames, account numbers, and other account information for third party sites and Internet services ("Third Party Sites").</li><li><b>Information from Third Party Sites:</b> In order to display information to you through a Service, we may collect, on your behalf, your account and other personal information from Third Party Sites that you register under your account via the Service. For example, if you register your Bank of America account with us, we will aggregate your Bank of America information via our Site in order to present it to you. If you choose to access bills online through our Services, we may store a PDF or HTML representation of your bills on our servers. We also integrate with a number of fitness devices. If you'd like to share this information with your family (who may not use these devices) we will ask you to sign into your account and authorize this integration.</li></ul><hr class=hr-privacy><h3>Security &amp; Audits</h3><p>Djed is committed to protecting your content and making secure as reasonably possible. The Djed Service is hosted in the Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) Cloud Infrastructure. We are using some the most up-to-date and secure features – such as the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud “VPC” (for a secure networking), AWS CloudHSM (Secure Key Management) and Amazon Simple Storage Service “S3” (for secure file storage). We use industry standard encryption to protect content in transit. (Our mobile app uses securely signed HTTPS requests according to the IETF HTTP Signatures specification)</p><p>We have retained an independent third party to conduct audits on a regular basis. They perform tests, make recommendations, and update us on the latest news on security and privacy.</p><p>If Djed learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on steps to take through the email address for your user account. We recommend that you take all appropriate steps to secure all devices that you use with Djed.</p><hr class=hr-privacy><h3>Tracking Information</h3><h4>Cookies</h4><p>A cookie is a small file stored on your computer or device to give you a unique ID. We use cookies to track new users of the Service and to recognize past users so that we may customize and personalize content and make the Service easier to use. Cookies used by the Service do not contain any personally identifiable information. If for any reason you don’t want to take advantage of cookies, you may have your browser not accept them, although this may disable or render unusable some of the features of the Service. We do not combine or associate any web usage information from cookies with personal information.</p><h4>Web Beacons</h4><p>Web beacons (sometimes called a web bug or clear gif) are typically very small graphic images (generally 1-by-1 pixel) that are invisible to the user, however any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail message, including an advertisement or HTML content, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are designed to allow us (or a third party) to collect certain statistical information and monitor user activity on our Service. Collected information can include the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the web user comes from, and the time the web beacon is activated (such as when you view the web page or e-mail that contains the web beacon). We may use web beacons for site administration purposes in connection with messages, content or e-mail messages you receive via the Service.</p><h3>Questions Or Complaints</h3><p>Questions or complaints concerning the collection or use of personal information by the Service or about this Privacy Policy should be directed to the contact points set forth below.</p><p>CONTACT INFORMATION:</p><p class="teal book">Djed Studios<br>115 E 5th Street, Suite 200<br>Austin, TX 78701<br><em>Attention: Legal Department</em><br><em>Phone: 1-512-739-2291</em><br><em>Email: <a href=mailto:legal@djed.com>legal@djed.com</a></em></p><h5><em>Policy Effective as of January 1, 2015</em></h5></div></div><hr class=footer><div class=row><div class="columns columns-full footer-navigation large-8 medium-12"><ul><li><a href="/">Djed</a></li><li><a href="/what-is-djed/">What is Djed</a></li><li><a href="/about/">About</a></li><li><a href="/press/">Press</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy</a></li><li><a href=https://djedstudios.zendesk.com target=_blank>FAQ</a></li><li><a href="/jobs/">Jobs</a></li><li class=footer-navigation-last><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></div><div class="columns columns-full footer-login large-4 medium-12"><a href=https://twitter.com/djedstudios target=_blank class=footer-twitter></a> <a href=https://www.facebook.com/DjedStudios target=_blank class=footer-facebook></a><div class=footer-divider>|</div><div class=footer-link><a href=http://app.djed.com>Login</a></div></div></div><div class="cover-modal none"></div><script src=/app.js></script><script>
