    <h2 class="book headline">Djed to Beta Launch Revolutionary New Family App During SXSW March 13</h2>
    <h4>Djed founder Darren Reid to speak at SXSW panel Friday, March 13 at JW Marriot Austin, Djed hosts media lounge daily during SXSW March 13-16</h4>
    <hr class="hr-press">
    <p><em>Austin, TX (March 2, 2015)</em> – Austin, Texas-based tech start-up Djed Studios today announced the March 13, 2015 preview release of their new application Djed, named after the Egyptian hieroglyphic representing stability.</p>
    <p>Pronounced “Jed,” the site is an all-encompassing “family” of applications and is the first comprehensive app designed specifically for families. It's a mobile and desktop web application for capturing and sharing all the family's vital information like health, wealth, projects, sports, school, trips, whatever a digital family needs. It's an integrated set of features including a Calendar, Contacts, Documents, Notes, Lists, Photos, Assets, and more. The most radical idea is that Djed allows a family to build a “Tribe,”—a list of people, like relatives and close friends—who can then share information with each other over this private network. Djed is a new and essential social productivity application for the family (and extended family) unit. Whether you’re at work or traveling or at home, Djed gives you one secure place to keep family content—safely and securely. Initially launched as a web app, Djed will deploy on iOS shortly after launch, with an Android version to come later in the year.</p>
    <p>CEO and founder Darren Reid has envisioned Djed “for more than ten years,” he recalls. Reid is a start-up veteran who has built and sold several enterprise application businesses over the past 25 years. He has specialized in highly secure applications built for teams and hundreds of clients in industries as varied as banking, healthcare, energy, and entertainment. Aside from Djed, Darren's a dad. He is married to a former GE executive, and has three children still at home. And Reid and his family manage the whole collaborative operation from Djed.</p>
    <p>The preview launch coincides with Reid’s solo SXSW discussion, “Why is My Company More Transparent Than My Family?” taking place at SXSW Interactive Friday, March 13 from 12:30-1:30PM in Salon 4 at the JW Marriott Austin, located at 110 East 2nd Street, Austin TX. Admission is limited to credentialed SXSW badge holders.</p>
	<p>Reid says, “We've been in Alpha for a few months but decided that during SXSW would be the perfect venue for us since we're based in Austin and because we're ready to share Djed with a much larger audience, get feedback, and see how it works for other families.”</p>
	<p>About the panel, he continues, “We’re mastering transparency in the workplace, yet still seem to be stumbling around in the dark when it comes to our most important job: our family. Our presentation will argue that, as relatively “good” people, we don’t intend to be less-than honest with our family; nor is it fun to be the only one in the family holding the burden of its critical information. Djed is one way that makes sharing information— and life—with our family and our “tribe,” more satisfying and less frustrating. We’ll present some of the surprising holes in family transparency we found while researching and building Djed, and talk about how families are changing faster than the technology that's supposed to be making their lives better.”</p>
	<p>Djed is a private place where family content can live for years and different families will use Djed in different ways, depending on their stage of life and what they'd like to keep track of. While a couple without children might use Djed primarily for things like planning an anniversary trip and day-to-day money management, larger families with school-aged children and busy lives might use it to schedule school activities, maintain a family budget, run a vacation property and keep track of aging parents’ health needs.</p>
	<p>With its extensive, varied set of features, there’s really no limit to how families can use Djed, be that something as simple as finding a better shared experience for family photos, or as in-depth as a secure place to store and share financial and medical histories and records. Trips, sports, arts, camps, health, hikes, and holidays, Djed has something for every family.</p>
	<p>Additionally, Djed is built like an enterprise app and supports simple but powerful permissions for all types of content, so mom and dad can manage money while the kids share photos and social schedules, and grandma and grandpa can keep up with the kids’ scholastic and athletic achievements.</p>
	<p>Djed has raised over $4 million so far from a celebrated list of angel investors including its founder, its Chairman Mark Booth, former European CEO of Netjets, restaurateur Danny Meyer (Shake Shack), and John Frieda, the English hair mogul, all of whom, Reid says, "are totally amazing Dads, devoted family dudes, with amazing families."</p>
	<p>Djed is hosting four days of hosted open houses at its offices at 5th and Brazos to showcase the app to media, invited guests and SXSW delegates. The daily program features regular demos of Djed, as well as varied refreshments. It runs Friday March 13 (2-5PM); Saturday, March 14 (11:00AM-5PM); Sunday, March 15 (noon-5:00PM) and Monday, March 16 (11:00AM-5PM) at Djed’s offices at 115 E. 5th Street, Suite 200, Austin, TX 78701. Admission is by appointment or with SXSW badge. Appointments are strongly suggested. RSVP to djed@platformgrp.com.</p>
	<p>“Amid the hubbub of SXSW, we’re showcasing Djed in a comfortable, family friendly environment,” Reid concludes. “We have cool offices with plenty of places to chill, plug in, hang out, have a drink, play some Xbox, and see a demo of Djed. We're also adding guests to our invite list, which we'll begin releasing for beta use during SXSW. We promise visitors an opportunity to see a deep dive into the making of Djed, the research, and all the feedback we've gotten so far, in a small-group environment. Our home will be your home for four days, managed by Djed.”</p>
